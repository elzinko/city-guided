  - id: no-unsolicited-documentation
    title: No Unsolicited Documentation
    level: MUST
    content: |
      - Documentation files (.md, .txt, etc.) MUST NOT be created or updated unless explicitly requested by the user
      - This includes:
        - README files
        - Technical documentation
        - API documentation
        - Architecture diagrams
        - Changelog files
        - Any markdown files
      - Exception: Code comments and inline documentation are allowed when they clarify complex logic
      - When documentation is requested, create it in the docs/ directory with clear structure
      
      Rationale: Documentation should be intentional and timely, not automatic. Let the user decide when documentation is needed.
