    title: Imperfect Documents Are OK
    content: |
      In Phase A (Exploration):
      - Documents can be incomplete
      - Questions can remain open
      - Details can be vague
      - The goal is to surface unknowns, not to have all answers

  - id: explore-before-commit
    title: Explore Before Committing
    content: |
      Before moving a feature to `candidate`:
      - Explore at least 2 alternative approaches
      - Identify the main risks and unknowns
      - Document the rationale for the chosen direction

  - id: timestamp-naming
    title: Use Timestamp Naming
    content: |
      All features and epics must use timestamp prefixes:
      - Format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-slug
      - Ensures chronological sorting
      - Example: 20260117143012-user-authentication

  - id: planning-is-truth
    title: Planning.md Is The Source of Truth
    content: |
      The planning.md file is the single source of truth for:
      - Feature status
      - Relative priority
      - Processing order
      
      Never duplicate this information in feature files.
