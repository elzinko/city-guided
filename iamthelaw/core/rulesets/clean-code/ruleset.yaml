tags: [code-quality, maintainability]

rules:
  - id: meaningful-names
    title: Use Meaningful Names
    level: MUST
    content: |
      - Variables, functions, and classes MUST have intention-revealing names
      - Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood
      - Use pronounceable names
      - Use searchable names (avoid single-letter variables except for loops)

  - id: small-functions
    title: Keep Functions Small
    level: SHOULD
    content: |
      - Functions SHOULD do one thing and do it well
      - Functions SHOULD be under 20 lines when possible
      - Extract logic into well-named helper functions
      - If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, extract it

  - id: no-side-effects
    title: Avoid Side Effects
    level: SHOULD
    content: |
      - Functions SHOULD not modify global state
      - Functions SHOULD be predictable (same input = same output)
      - If side effects are necessary, make them explicit in the function name

  - id: dry-principle
    title: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
    level: SHOULD
    content: |
      - Avoid duplicating code logic
      - Extract common patterns into reusable functions
      - BUT: Don't over-abstract prematurely (Rule of Three)

  - id: comments
    title: Comments Are a Last Resort
    level: MAY
    content: |
      - Code SHOULD be self-documenting
      - Comments MAY explain "why", not "what"
      - Delete commented-out code (use version control instead)
      - TODOs are acceptable but should be tracked
